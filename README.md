Hi, I’m @sraby4723, I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science in my second year.
- I’m interested in computer architecture and the design of microprocessors, such as x86-64 CPUs offered by AMD and Intel. I also have a huge interest in Linux, and am currently running it as my main operating system, which I have customized to my own needs. Along with that, I love to self host, and I have my own personal server/NAS for data storage and such.
- I’m currently learning about microprocessors, Assembly language, digital and analog signals, and the inner workings of Arch Linux by nature of my use of it and troubleshooting.
- I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, like programs for Linux
- Pronouns: she/her
